(ns meet.app
  "meet-mcp-component appview — reagent + re-frame, view built from
  jp-go-dds (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup.

  Faithful port of the previous SvelteKit scaffold's status page
  (`svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte`, ~84 lines): a static display of this
  Worker's own declared surface — title / project / kind, route count +
  list, wrangler var keys, an XRPC-enabled flag, and its own source path.
  Every field below mirrors the constant `app` object `+page.svelte` held
  in its <script> block; nothing here is invented and nothing is
  simplified away — including the routeCount 0 / routes [] mismatch
  against this repo's wrangler.jsonc (which does declare two routes):
  that mismatch pre-existed in the Svelte page and is ported as-is, not
  corrected, because this is a frontend migration, not a data audit.

  Two fields are updated, not simplified, to stay honest about what this
  migration itself changed:

  - `:app/relative-path` now names this file, not the deleted Svelte one.
  - `:app/xrpc?` stays `true`, but for a different reason than the Svelte
    page recorded it. This migration's wrangler.jsonc sets `main` to
    `src/app.ts` (see that file's header comment and the repo README):
    `src/app.ts` calls `env.ASSETS.fetch` AND has its own
    `/xrpc/com.etzhayyim.apps.meet.*` handler that proxies to
    `DISPATCHER_URL`, so XRPC is genuinely reachable through the deployed
    Worker after this migration. That is a *different* mechanism from
    the one this page used to imply: the Svelte-era XRPC handler
    (`/xrpc/[...path]` → the AgentGateway MCP router, JSON-RPC
    `tools/call`) is preserved byte-for-byte at `src/xrpc-proxy.ts`
    (moved, not deleted, from
    `svelte/src/routes/xrpc/[...path]/+server.ts`) but is NOT wired into
    `src/app.ts` and does not run — backend Worker/XRPC code is out of
    scope for a frontend migration, so this namespace does not decide
    whether to revive it.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced once, at authoring
  time, by `jp-go-dds.page/->page` running on the JVM (via this deps.edn's
  jp-go-dds git/sha), concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with
  `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css` — exactly what `jp-go-dds.page/page` composes
  for its own <style> block. This namespace only requires
  `jp-go-dds.core` — the browser bundle does not need `jp-go-dds.page` or
  `html.core` at runtime; those are JVM-only tools used to author the
  static shell once. Regenerate that shell (e.g. if jp-go-dds's core
  components or ext-rules change) with:

    (require '[jp-go-dds.page :as page] '[clojure.java.io :as io])
    (spit \"public/index.html\"
          (page/->page {:title \"meet-mcp-component\"
                         :lang \"ja\"
                         :description \"meet-mcp-component — Google Meet thin edge facade appview (reagent + re-frame + jp-go-dds).\"
                         :css (slurp (io/resource \"jp_go_dds/dds.css\"))}
                        [:div {:id \"app\"} \"meet-mcp-component loading…\"]
                        [:script {:src \"js/app.js\"}]))"
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [jp-go-dds.core :as dds]))
